        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda"target="_blank">Swami Vivekananda</a>Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion and spirituality. <br>
        He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a monk. After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent, acquiring first-hand knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. <br>
        Moved by their plight, he resolved to help his country men, and found a way to travel to the United States, where he was highly successful. <br>
        In India, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training for monastics and householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission, to provide charity, social work and education.<br>
         Vivekananda was also a major force in contemporary Hindu reform movements, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India.<br>
          He is regarded as a patriotic saint, and his birthday in India is celebrated as National Youth Day.
